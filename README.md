A chronological journey through building malware detection models, from custom datasets to established benchmarks.

## The Journey

### Phase 1: Building Our Own Dataset (The Hard Way)

#### Initial Ambition
We started with an ambitious goal: build a malware detection system from scratch using our own dataset. We combined two major sources:
- **SOREL-20M**: A massive malware dataset with 20 million samples from [https://github.com/sophos/SOREL-20M/tree/master](https://github.com/sophos/SOREL-20M/tree/master)
- **Assemblage PE**: Benign PE files from [https://huggingface.co/datasets/changliu8541/Assemblage_PE/tree/main](https://huggingface.co/datasets/changliu8541/Assemblage_PE/tree/main)

#### Feature Engineering
We extracted approximately 350 features per sample, including:
- **PE Metadata**: File headers, section information, import/export tables
- **Byte Histogram**: 256-bin frequency distribution of byte values
- **Entropy Analysis**: Overall and per-section entropy calculations
- **Windows API Calls**: Categorized by functionality (file, registry, network, process, memory, system, crypto, anti-debug)

#### First Attempt: Deep Neural Network
Our initial approach used a DNN architecture. The results were... disappointing. Performance was essentially random guessing, suggesting our feature representation or model architecture wasn't capturing the underlying patterns.

#### Pivot to XGBoost
We switched to XGBoost to establish a baseline. The results were surprisingly good... too good. This raised our suspicions about potential dataset bias.

#### Reality Check: External Validation
To validate our results, we brought in a test dataset from another source that combined malware and benign samples. The performance dropped to random guessing levels, revealing a critical insight: **our original dataset was biased because malware and benign samples came from different distributions**.

### Phase 2: Embracing the Ember Dataset

#### Learning from Experience
After the sobering results with our custom dataset, we decided to use the established **Ember dataset** - a well-curated, balanced dataset specifically designed for malware detection research.

#### Building Our Subset
We created a manageable subset of 100K samples with 700 features.

#### XGBoost Success
The results were impressive:
- **Accuracy**: ~87%
- **False Positive Rate**: < 1%
- **Training Time**: Few dozen seconds
- **Data Usage**: 10x less than our original attempt

These results are particularly noteworthy when compared to the [Ember paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1804.04637), where we achieved similar performance with significantly less data and training time.

#### DNN Redux
We revisited deep learning with the Ember dataset, but results remained suboptimal:
- **Accuracy**: ~60%
- **False Positive Rate**: < 50%

## Key Lessons Learned

1. **Distribution Matters**: Malware and benign samples must come from similar real-world distributions
2. **Baseline First**: XGBoost provided an excellent baseline that helped us understand what was achievable
3. **Feature Engineering**: Our custom features showed promise but needed proper validation
4. **Established Benchmarks**: The Ember dataset provided a reliable foundation for model development
5. **Accuracy is relative**: for this kind of task you want to look for FPR and TPR
